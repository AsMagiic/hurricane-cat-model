# Hurricane Cat Model — Florida Homeowners (v3)

## Status
v2.0 is frozen at tag `v2.0` (location-level model, fully functional).
This branch targets v3 — do not break v2 behaviour without a clear decision log entry.

## v2 baseline (frozen)
- 1,000 synthetic FL coastal locations | TIV USD 500M
- Hazard: stochastic moving-track, illustrative parameters (lambda=0.7/yr)
- Vulnerability: HAZUS-anchored logistic damage curves, 4 construction types
- Finance: three-layer per-occurrence XoL tower, 140M capacity, retention 60M, exhaustion 200M
  (Layer 1: 40M xs 60M / Layer 2: 50M xs 100M / Layer 3: 50M xs 150M);
  attachments illustrative, to be re-anchored to OEP return periods in Phase 4
- Catalog: 100,000 simulated years, seed=42
- EP utils: `model/ep_utils.py` — single source of truth (convention: p_k = k/N)
- Outputs: AEP/OEP gross+net EP curves, PML 1-in-100/250, AAL, ep_master.png

## v3 goals (in order)
1. **Hazard calibration** — fit frequency/track parameters to HURDAT2; replace
   illustrative lambda with basin-season empirical distribution
2. **Wind model** — Holland B profile with translation asymmetry;
   Kaplan-DeMaria inland decay applied along track
3. **Secondary uncertainty** — Beta-distributed damage ratios per event;
   propagate epistemic uncertainty into EP bands
4. **Exposure & financials** — OED exposure format (LocPerilsCovered, etc.);
   ELT and YLT outputs; reinstatements on XoL layers
5. **Backtesting** — reproduce Andrew 1992 and Ian 2022 industry loss estimates
   as validation benchmarks

## Conventions (mandatory for all v3 code)
- **Config over code**: every tuneable parameter lives in `config/*.yaml`;
  nothing hardcoded in model files
- **Units in every docstring**: wind speed functions must declare units
  (kt / mph / m/s) — silent conversion bugs are the #1 wind-model failure mode
- **Seeds explicit everywhere**: `np.random.default_rng(seed)` only;
  no module-level RNG state
- **Tests required**: every statistical module in `model/` gets a matching
  `tests/test_<module>.py` using pytest; CI must stay green

## Stack
Python 3.11+, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, pyyaml, pytest

## Decisions log
<!-- Add entries as: `YYYY-MM-DD — decision — rationale` -->
- 2026-06-10 — renamed tower layers Working/Middle/Cat High → Layer 1/2/3 — "Working" implies a high-frequency attachment; this tower attaches at 60M (~1-in-25yr trigger), so the label was technically inaccurate
- 2026-06-10 — v2 tower attachments (60/100/150M) are illustrative round numbers — to be re-anchored to OEP return periods in Phase 4 (Paso 4.1), with per-layer expected loss, ROL and reinstatements
